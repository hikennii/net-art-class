    <p>A delicate net art work that plays with duality, perception, and meaning. The work displays mirrored pairs of images and words, challenging the audience to decide whether they are perceiving something good or bad—half full or half empty. The application of repetition and symmetry in the work highlights how minimal variations in framing can entirely alter one's perception of the same thing or concept. The interactive aspect—moving from paired images or text—chases the viewer to an active position. This interaction generates personal reflection and more intimate and reflective experience.</p>
