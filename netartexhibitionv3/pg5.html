    <p>An early web-based net art work that takes the viewer on a dreamlike and nonsequential ride through dozens of linked web pages. Every click generates strange images, mysterious messages, or experimental design games that are more akin to navigating a virtual maze than surfing a site. The interactivity of Superbad heightens its effect by placing control in the hands of the viewer. Since every click reveals something new, users become increasingly engaged and curious, coming together more intensely as they learn and interpret the work in their own terms.</p>
