    <p>A politically explosive net art installation that visually represents the interconnectedness of America's corporate power elite. The installation tracks the board members of large corporations and demonstrates how power flows through multiple networks of influence. In rendering the unseen connections visible, the piece precludes the concentration of corporate power and deconstructs the ideal of transparency in capitalist economies. The interactive aspect is at the heart of the ideaâ€”users can click through firms, view board member connections, and even map their own. This hands-on sense of touch makes the data more real and tangible, taking seemingly intangible power dynamics and making them something concrete and traceable.</p>
